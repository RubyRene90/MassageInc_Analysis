# MassageInc_Analysis
Client and Incoming Data Analysis for a real, small massage business under alias.

MassageINC Repository includes:
    -Link to google sheets which contains data, tables, and aggregated data
    -uploaded PDF of the Analysis Report
    -uploaded PDF of Analysis Documentation
    -SQL queries used to generate tables and aggregated data
    -Google Slides presentation on Analysis findings

I enjoyed working with this clients data and felt the owner of MassageINC
was happy with the information I was able to pull from their business. I was able to 
learn a lot and come up with ideas to help complete a future analysis project more efficiently.
